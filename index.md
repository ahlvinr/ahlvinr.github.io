Welcome to my Data Science webpage for Homework 05.

Below you can exlpore my project work:

- Data Sources and Project Ideas:
- Where's Schueller? Vizualization Analysis:

Below is an interactive Plotly visualization from my geolocation analysis, showing Professor Schueller's movement across each season.

For my Above and Beyond component, I added an additional visualization showing Professor Schueller's travel distance by day of the week, separated by season.

This site will eventually host my final data analysis project and interactive visualizations.
